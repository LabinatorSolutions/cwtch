# Cwtch

An experimental Javascript chess engine with a very simple (768 x 64)x1 x 1 NNUE eval. 

Internal data generation, random init boot network, DIY Javascript trainer.

The goal of the project is to determine if Javascript is fast enough to handle a NNUE eval, by testing it against my HCE engine Lozza.
